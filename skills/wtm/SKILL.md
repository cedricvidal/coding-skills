description: Worktree Merge (WTM) workflow — use when the user asks to implement a task using the WTM method, a git worktree, or mentions "worktree merge". This skill orchestrates creating a worktree + branch, coding in isolation, committing incrementally, and merging via PR.

# Worktree PR Merge (WTM) Workflow

## Usage

**USE FOR:**
- new features that require coding
- users asks to use the WTM method

**DO NOT USE FOR:**
- asks a question which doesn't require coding

## Workflow walkthrough

When the user asks to perform a coding task using the **WTM method**, follow this end-to-end workflow:

### 1. Determine base branch

- Check the current branch (`git branch --show-current`).
- If the current branch is a mainline branch (`main`, `dev`, `integration`, or similar), use it as the **base branch**.
- Always fetch and use the remote tracking branch (e.g. `origin/main`) to ensure the worktree is created off the latest code.
- If the current branch is a feature/fix branch, **ask the user which branch to create the new branch off of** (suggest `main` as the default). Wait for the user's answer.
- **Remember the chosen `<base-branch>`** — it will be used later as the PR base.

### 2. Create worktree & branch

- Derive a short `<task-name>` from the user's request (e.g. `fix-login-bug`, `add-export-csv`).
- Fetch the latest from origin before creating the worktree:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin <base-branch>
  ```
- Create a new branch and worktree off `origin/<base-branch>` to ensure it starts from the latest remote state:
  ```bash
  git worktree add <workspace-path>/.worktrees/<task-name> -b <branch-name> origin/<base-branch>
  ```
- Default location: `<workspace-path>/.worktrees/<task-name>` (override if the user specifies a different path).
- Branch naming should follow the repo convention (e.g. `feat/<task-name>`, `fix/<task-name>`).

### 3. Code in the worktree

- If the task is simple, start implementing right away inside the worktree directory.
- If the task is complex, present a plan first and get confirmation before coding.
- All file operations (reads, edits, creates) happen inside the worktree path.

### 4. Commit incrementally

- Commit after each logical step — do **not** batch everything into one giant commit.
- Always explicitly list files to stage (never use `git add .` or `git add -A`).

#### When a PR has already been created for this branch

If a PR was previously created (Step 5) for this branch, use the optimistic one-liner to guard against committing to an already-merged branch:

```bash
cd <worktree-path> && [[ $(GH_PAGER=cat gh pr view <branch-name> --json state --jq '.state' 2>/dev/null) != 'MERGED' ]] && git add <file1> <file2> && git commit -m '<descriptive message>'
```

**How it works:**
- If no PR exists yet → `gh pr view` fails → empty string ≠ `MERGED` → **commit proceeds**.
- If PR is `OPEN` → `OPEN` ≠ `MERGED` → **commit proceeds**.
- If PR is `MERGED` → `MERGED` = `MERGED` → **commit is skipped**.

**When the commit is skipped** (the PR was already merged):
1. **Do not commit.** Inform the user that the PR for this branch has already been merged.
2. Offer to create a **new branch** off the original `<base-branch>` (fetching the latest remote) to continue the work. Let the user choose between:
   - **New worktree** — create a fresh worktree with the new branch (start again from Step 2).
   - **Reuse current worktree** — switch the current worktree to the new branch via `git switch -c <new-branch> <base-branch>`.

#### When no PR exists yet

Use the standard commit command (no merge check needed):

```bash
cd <worktree-path> && git add <file1> <file2> && git commit -m '<descriptive message>'
```

### 5. Push & create PR (on user request)

When the user is happy and asks to merge / submit:

1. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   cd <worktree-path> && git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
   ```
2. Create a pull request using `gh`, targeting the `<base-branch>` chosen in step 1:
   ```bash
   GH_PAGER=cat gh pr create --draft --title '<title>' --body-file <body-file> --base <base-branch> --head <branch-name>
   ```
3. If a plan file was created for this task (e.g. `plan.md`), read it and include its full contents as-is in the PR body.
4. For long PR descriptions, write the body to a temp file first and use `--body-file`.
5. After the PR is created, **ask the user if they want to mark it as ready for review**. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.

### 6. Mark ready for review

Whenever the user wants to mark the PR as ready (whether right after creation or later):

1. Mark the PR as ready for review:
   ```bash
   GH_PAGER=cat gh pr ready <pr-number-or-url>
   ```
2. After the PR is marked ready, **ask the user if they want to merge it**. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.

### 7. Merge & clean up

Whenever the user wants to merge (whether right after marking ready or later), **ask what merge strategy to use**: squash, merge commit, or rebase. Default to **squash**.

1. Merge the PR using the chosen strategy (`--squash`, `--merge`, or `--rebase`):
   ```bash
   GH_PAGER=cat gh pr merge <pr-number-or-url> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
2. After a successful merge, **ask the user if they want to delete the worktree**. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.
3. If the user confirms, remove the worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <workspace-path>/.worktrees/<task-name>
   ```

> **Note:** Always wait for explicit user confirmation before marking the PR as ready, merging the PR, or deleting the worktree. If the user declines at any prompt, stop and leave things as-is.
